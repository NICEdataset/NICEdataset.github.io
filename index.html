          Emotion and empathy are examples of human qualities lacking in many human-machine 
          interactions. The goal of our work is to generate engaging dialogue grounded in a 
          user-shared image with increased emotion and empathy while minimizing socially 
          inappropriate or offensive outputs. We release the Neural Image Commenting Evaluation 
          (NICE) dataset consisting of almost two million images and their corresponding, 
          human-generated comments, as well as a set of baseline models and over 28,000 human 
          annotated samples. Instead of relying on manually labeled emotions, we also use 
          automatically generated linguistic representations as a source of weakly supervised 
          labels. Based on the annotations, we define two different task settings on the NICE 
          dataset.

          Then, we propose a novel model - Modeling Affect Generation for Image 
          Comments (MAGIC) - which aims to generate comments for images, conditioned on 
          the linguistic representations that capture style and affect, and to help generate 
          more empathetic, emotional, engaging and socially appropriate comments. Using this 
          model we are achieve state-of-the art performance on one setting and set a benchmark 
          for the NICE dataset. Experiments show that our proposed method can generate more 
          human-like and engaging image comments.
